# Red-Yoinker
If you are not a programmer, you may want to use [this tool](https://redditdownloader.github.io/) instead (NOTE: that website is not made by me). It has a GUI meaning that it is a normal application like a Music Player or Microsoft Words with visuals instead of a command line application where you need to type your commands. It also does similar things as this app, so you are not missing on anything.

Red-Yoinker is a CLI app to download images and videos from reddit.com. This app has 2 different subcommands: **scrap** and **history**. The scrap subcommand will allow you to analyze or download content from your favorite subreddits while the history subcommand will allow you to keep track of downloaded content and any media which could not be downloaded. It will also allow you to retry downloading them. The **usage** section will go in depth on what each subcommand and option does.

### Dependencies
If you want to use the source code, you will have to use [ratelimit](https://pypi.org/project/ratelimit/) or remove it's uses from [mediadownloader.py](https://github.com/maxensdestine/Red-Yoinker/blob/main/mediadownloader.py) and [pushshiftscrapper.py](https://github.com/maxensdestine/Red-Yoinker/blob/main/pushshiftscrapper.py) (the @limit annotations). Please know that not using rate limits may cause the program to be unable to download many images and videos.

### Limits of This App
This app cannot download media from every submission. The supported format are currently: content hosted on reddit (images, videos) including galleries, imgur links to single images, imgur link to galleries (sometimes fails). Also, the min score and max score use the values from pushshift which are often different than the real ones. This is because pushshift does not update these numbers after storing a submission on their servers. You can still use those options, but keep in mind that they are mostly incorrect, especially for large numbers.

## Usage
### Calling Examples
You must use scrap or history, but not both at the same time. The general options must come before the any of the subcommands and their options.
Here is an example which displays the name of the first 50 submissions with at least 10 upvotes, posted between 2018 August 30 and 2020 September 24, from the subreddits movie and nba and also store them in the history: `python3 redyoinker.py -subs "movie nba" scrap -t 1 -r 4 -sm 10 -s 50 -b 2020-09-24 -a "2018-08-30 -h -ti" `
Here is another example which displays the full link and downloads media (images or videos) of the first 8 submissions with at least 3 upvotes, posted between 2018 August 30 and 2020 September 24 from the subreddits movie and nba and also store them in the history: `python3 redyoinker.py -subs "movie nba" scrap -t 1 -r 4 -sm 3 -s 8 -b 2020-09-24 -a "2018-08-30 -h -fl -d "/home/mydirectory/" `
